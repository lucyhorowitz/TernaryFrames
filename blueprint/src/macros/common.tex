% This should be most of your macros.

% The theorem-like environments defined below are those that appear by default

% The configuration below use the theorem counter for all those environments
% (this is what the [theorem] arguments mean) and never resets it.
% If you want for instance to number them within chapters then you can add
% [chapter] at the end of the next line.
